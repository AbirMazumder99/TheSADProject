# TheSADProject

Environment Setup
1. Install NodeJs
2. Install expo client [npm install -g expo-cli]
3. Create a new project [expo init SAD]
4. Start your server [npm start]

# App.js

1. Install React Navigation [npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack]
2. Install peer dependencies [expo install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view moment]

# Issues
1. Always run [expo install <package-name>] when install packages/dependencies. If dependencies ever become incompatible with expo, run [expo update]
2. Muse use firebase v7.9.0
